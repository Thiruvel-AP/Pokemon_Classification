# Pokemon_Classification
  - Created a multiple model to predict the pokemon's data
  - A multi-output prediction model predicts multiple target variables from the input.
# PLAN
   - if the input is Name, Type1, Type2, then the model will predict the Evolution
   - if the input is Name, Evolution then the model will predict the primary type (Type 1)
   - if the input is Name, Type1, evolution, then the model will predict the secondary type (Type 2)
