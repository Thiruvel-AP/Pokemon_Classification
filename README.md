# Pokemon_Classification
  Created a multi-output model to predict the pokemon's data 
  A multi-output model predicts multiple target variables from the same input.
  PLAN 
      = if the input is Name, Type1, Type2, then the model will predict the Evolution
      = if the input is Name, Evolution then the model will predict the primary type(Type1)
      = if the input is Name, Type1, evolution, then the model will predict the sccondary type(Type2)
